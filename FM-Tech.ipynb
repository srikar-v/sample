This \"Getting There from Here\" discussion deals with the shift in thinking and action that we all must make to deal with the rapid change that is upon us.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur August Autonomous Actions on the Intelligent Edge discussions in addition to our theme for AHRExpo Chicago education sessions, “The Future of Building Automation — Data at the Open Intelligent Edge\" have identified an immediate problem in our industry of how the transformation we all must make will occur.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this thought provoking podcast with Ken and Eric of Control Trends, we start the shift of thought discussion. This link goes directly to the podcast — the only image is the podcast controls — so you will have to turn up your volume. Please jump in at the 11.5 to 52-minute mark and share your thoughts directly with me, or on social media, or come to our education sessions in Chicago.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur smart building automation industry needs to follow the auto industry in reinventing ourselves to look and think like the self-learning software companies we are morphing into. Who will become the new building data architects and the virtual building software companies of our future?\\n\\n\\n\\nHow will we create value from our new-found data and bring it back to the hive to discover new ways of providing comfort, health, and satisfaction in our buildings?\\n\\n\\n\\nOne very positive part of our transformation is that the new feedstock of people assets \"the new kids on the block\" who are coming into our industry are creators and makers and very well understand IoT views plus the importance of open and standards. In addition, they dislike our propitiatory approaches and reside on the opposite side of transformation urging us to change our ways. This positive force makes us think younger, differently, about how we will grow people powered self-driving buildings from the intelligent self-learning self-acting edge.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article has a wake-up call, \"BACnet has a lot of beneficial aspects that are absolutely relevant, but so was the video cassette before Netflix.\" This is the article: So you think you know the future of IoT? “IoT WILL have an overwhelming impact on the Building Automation controls industry and you should know more about it,” says Hector Hernandez, CEO, Founder CUBE-USA, and author of the article.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have much to learn from the evolving self-driving autonomous cars and how can we make our buildings more self-driving and improve our client/customer experience with continuous connection starting at the edge and moving the bit of intelligences, intelligently.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is all about a data strategy what to and how to collect data at the open intelligent edge.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat kind of transformation are we talking about? Ponder this from Tom Goodwin:\\n\\n\\n\\nUber: The world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles.\\n\\nFacebook: The world’s most popular media owner, creates no content.\\n\\nAlibaba: The most valuable retailer, has no inventory.\\n\\nAirBnB: The world’s largest accommodation provider owns no real estate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article provides further insight: Data is eating the software that is eating the world. \"The data-driven machine learning algorithms that power AI will not only upend programming, but lower the barriers to AI itself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA key thought: \"it has become clear to everyone, especially the old-school disruptors cited by Andreessen, that \\'software,\\' as it’s normally understood, is not the secret to future success. Going forward, the agent of disruption will be the data-driven ML (machine learning) algorithms that power AI. In this new era, more of the logic that powers intelligent applications won’t be explicitly programmed. The days of predominantly declarative, deterministic, and rules-based application development are fast drawing to a close. Instead, the probabilistic logic at the heart of chatbots, recommendation engines, self-driving vehicles, and other AI-powered applications is being harvested directly from source data.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider this article, Legacy technology – an enabler to digital transformation, not a barrier: “This engagement often uncovers information that can not only inform a transformative approach, but enhance and accelerate progress by avoiding the re-invention of the proverbial wheels.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are many organisations that have successfully harnessed the power of legacy systems and delivered the content or processing power of these through fresh, modern interfaces or mobile apps to their customers.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this review, The Evolution of the Master System Integrator (MSI), we learn more about the new/old reinvented kids on the block.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are lots of fancy names for this work, but I would say we really are just helping clients make the best choices on the many diverse technology options they have for buildings and helping them implement these solutions with high levels of performance. Consulting, MSI, engineering ... they are all just value-added services from a trusted adviser.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is no technology or service that should be a priority for smart building designers, the real value (benefit) comes from the cumulative effect of the 20 or 50 or 100 different solutions that are integrated into the smart system that is the building” — Ken Dooley, Senior Specialist — Digitalisation Granlund.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet we want MSI to be more or evolve more new identities such as building data architects? Master data integrators? Data engineers? Data gods? Definers of the edge and the middle and cloud?\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article talks about the evolving roles of data engineers, The Wouda, Couda, and OODA of Building Performance Data Engineering: “As part of the Project Haystack open-source community, I’m learning that small can equal big, and less can be more, and that ‘big data’ engineers and ‘building performance data engineers’ have important but different roles in the coming era of the IoT and machine learning” — Therese Sullivan, Building Context Ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\nCory Vanderpool embraces the shift of thought: “Cardinal IoT is built on Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) open platform. The solution includes three critical ‘things,’ the first of which starts with the end devices, which in this case are wireless, self powered sensors that exist at the ‘edge.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanies mashup to provide new services. “Our technologies are very complementary, where the CogniPoint monitors the building’s space and provides real-time data about its occupants’ whereabouts and their count. This data is used by Mapiq’s space management and utilization software to deliver real-time building intelligence that allows organizations to improve operations and workplace efficiency” — Itmar Roth, PointGrab and Sander Schutte, Mapiq.\\n\\n\\n\\nI believe we need to recreate ourselves and do what we never imagined set a path for the shift of thought and action we all need to make. Master system integrator and data engineers will hurry the transformation that it needs to occur in the \"getting there from here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNext June I am off to Helsinki to be part of and find more about the Nordic Smart Building Convention 2018. From the website: “In 2018 Buildings have changed. Humans and buildings have become a well-oiled machine. ID-tagged humans carry ID-tagged devices, use ID-tagged clothing. Behavior control, information control, emotion control, building control … everything is monitored and kept under control. When the building is under total control, choice becomes routine. Nordic Smart Building Convention 2018 is coming and will lead the reconstruction revolution.”\\n\\n\\n\\nKen Sinclair is the founder, owner, and publisher of an online resource called AutomatedBuildings.com.

       " 'If Buildings Could Talk: Smart Buildings, IoT, Safety, and the Bottom Line\\n\\nBy Joe Hernandez\\n\\n\\n\\nMy colleagues and I often think about the nature of the buildings we spend so much of our time in as we go about our day to day lives. We work in them, are entertained in them, dine in them, and are even healed in them. Some are uncomfortable, unhealthy, poorly lit, and unsafe. Some are just okay. Others are smart, sophisticated, clean, and environmentally-tuned marvels. They sense when lighting is required and what type, they know when it’s getting too warm or too cold. They can see things with cameras. They can sense when someone is inside them. They are becoming more intelligent and seem to be able to think as if they had their own mind.\\n\\nInterestingly, we will begin to see more of these intelligent buildings. The reason is clear. These buildings are simply more cost effective. But beyond the cost drivers are a set of compelling revenue implications that can’t be ignored. In a recent study by Jones Lang LaSalle, buildings that are considered “intelligent” sell at a premium of up to 17 percent over traditional buildings. They enjoy up to 18 percent higher occupancy and achieve up to a mind-blowing 30 percent higher lease rate than their unintelligent cousins. It’s this kind of data that explains why Frost and Sullivan estimates the smart building market will reach $26 billion by 2019.\\n\\nBuildings are getting a brain, and we are in a way enabling them to talk via a key driver — the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is all about interconnection. It allows for everyday objects, in our case HVAC, lighting, alarms and sensors, to send and receive data via the Internet.\\n\\nNow that buildings can talk, what would they tell us? What language would we have to learn to understand them? And, if we could understand, what questions would we ask them?\\n\\nA facility manager might ask: How are you feeling today? Do you have any aches and pains? Can you tell me what’s bothering you, or better yet, show me where it hurts? Did your HVAC system continue to operate off grid last night? Did today’s storm knock out power to your surveillance cameras?\\n\\nA first responder would want to know: What’s going on inside? How bad is it? Where is the issue? And what’s the best path to get to the problem? Is there a back stairwell? How many exits are on each floor? Are the elevators currently operational?\\n\\nThe more we communicate with buildings, the more they will keep us comfortable, healthy, and safe. The sensors, cameras, HVAC, and lighting will enhance the places in which we work, making the building a material strategic element to our businesses. It becomes an enabler for productivity improvements, margin gains, and growth.\\n\\nMore importantly though, smart building technology can offer improvements to public safety. Smart buildings can provide safe environments for hotel guests, students, spectators, travelers at airports and train stations, hospital patients and healthcare providers, as well as first responders.\\n\\nHowever, the more sophisticated systems we deploy in our buildings, the more complex they become to manage. Each system requires some degree of expertise to program it, secure it, run it, maintain it, and speak its language.\\n\\nNo one person can master all these systems. Does this mean we need a team of highly trained facilities engineers and cyber security experts to manage these systems? Where do we find these people? Can we afford them? Without them, will we ever realize the proposed cost savings or revenue upside promised with the enablement of smart building technology? With them, will the expense to employ them offset any gains we receive?\\n\\nThankfully, there is a solution. Through smart visual mapping, connected building systems and predictive/prescriptive analytics, technology is changing the game for both first responders and facility managers.\\n\\nJoe Hernandez is CEO of BuildingDNA. He is a 9-1-1 safety services veteran serves as adjunct professor at The University of Denver, Daniels School of Business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Building Internet of Things PAGE\\n\\nUnderstanding Your Building Internet of Things Options\\n\\nAs technology rapidly changes, facility managers should study the best and most efficient ways to add function and capability to their current operation. As technology rapidly changes, facility managers should study the best and most efficient ways to add function and capability to their current operation.\\n\\nBy Joseph Aamidor August 2017 - Building Automation Article Use Policy\\n\\nBuilding management technology is rapidly changing. The advent of cloud computing and big data, plus the proliferation of smart meters and other Internet-connected “things,” all provide more data-driven outcomes for buildings and their subsystems. These Building IoT developments present opportunities and challenges to facility managers. Opportunities include an increase in data that can lead to greater efficiency, avoided equipment repairs, and lower operating costs. But these new sources of data require training and ongoing staff time to properly analyze the outputs and take action. Procuring new Building IoT technologies may require new vendor relationships, too. And there are many new vendors in the building technology space, primarily selling software-enabled solutions to building owners. Various analyst and research firms cite between 150 and 250 startups with operations-focused building technology software solutions.\\n\\nThe market for these technologies is fragmented and complex. One way to understand this rapidly expanding landscape is by type of offering. Building technology requires a number of components that form a technology stack. This stack is made up of a variety of hardware and software components. In some cases, a firm will build all of the stack components (or a significant number of them) and in other cases, a firm will simply focus on a single part of the stack, selling the technology to a variety of other vendors across different building types.\\n\\nTechnology platforms: Core components\\n\\n“Stack” is a term used in the software industry referring to integrated products and services that act as components of an overall platform and provide a full solution to end users. The technology stack is evolving but includes a few core components:\\n\\n• On-premise hardware: Within commercial buildings, many hardware devices act as sensor points, including thermostats, HVAC components, lighting fixtures, and energy meters.\\n\\n• On-premise networking/communications: This includes the various protocols, like BACnet and Modbus, which allow on-premise hardware devices to communicate with each other.\\n\\n• On-premise software: Software applications that enable facility managers to operate their systems (such as HVAC), monitor trends, and take action. (Note: Some of these software products can be accessed from outside the building via remote connection.)\\n\\n• Building-to-cloud communications: As buildings become connected to the cloud, there are hardware gateway products that use application programming interfaces (APIs) and Internet access to send data to the cloud.\\n\\n• Cloud platforms: Once the building data has been sent to the cloud, it can be used for a variety of applications (visualization, analysis, reporting, etc). Additionally, there are other relevant sources of data, such as weather, utility bills, and rate tariffs, which can be imported to these platforms. Some of the data providers (for weather, bills, tariffs) could become cloud platforms in the energy industry.\\n\\n• Cloud applications: The line between cloud applications and cloud platforms in the building industry is grey. That said, some vendors focus on purpose-specific applications (e.g., an occupant dashboard for engagement) rather than a full-featured platform and ecosystem. Some platform providers have begun to open up to third party application developers, which is a model similar to Apple’s App Store.\\n\\n• Implementation and integration services: This is not typically thought of as part of a traditional technology stack. But because there are so many systems integrators in the building space, and some of them build their own software, they should be included.\\n\\nVendors that build the majority of this technology stack are delivering a vertically integrated solution. Vendors that focus on a single component within the stack take a horizontal approach. An example of a vertical solution is a next-generation intelligent building automation system, which may have proprietary metering hardware to collect granular energy data, technology to send this on-premise hardware data to the cloud, analysis capabilities to identify anomalies, and a user interface to deliver this information to users. An example of a horizontal solution is a hardware device that can collect a specific stream of data, such as energy demand (kW), which can be integrated with other installed software, such as an existing BAS.\\n\\nComments',\n",
       " 'Autonomous Actions on the Intelligent Edge\\n\\nBy Ken Sinclair\\n\\n\\n\\nPowerful low-cost edge controllers using open source software are changing the industry landscape. Intelligent Edge Computing changes machine learning\\'s location, bringing more power with an autonomous personality even closer to the edge while providing the foundation for a decentralized architecture creating machine distributed collaboration.\\n\\nThe joke in our industry is that we are either moving towards or away from centralization. The latest trend sees us moving our present cloud power to the edge driven by low cost, extremely powerful controllers capable of a decentralized collaboration. Although this embodies a lot of new concepts it is not that different than the microprocessor revolution of the early 1980s when the power of mainframe and mini was pushed to stand-alone controllers.\\n\\nFrom our lead article, Your Buildings’ 21st Century Edge, \"What are the takeaway lessons here regarding how edge analytics controllers will disrupt the current building industry?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe article says: “Looking at what is happening in edge control and analytics in cars is a good way to understand how comparable technology will bring buildings into line with 21st Century service demands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We see, for example, that new edge controllers — those that support the full software stack needed to collect, store and run analytics on time-series data from a building’s many digitized sources — are going to be a powerful force in building automation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will follow the autonomous car\\'s development of extremely powerful edge implementations to achieve autonomous interaction for our industry. Simple pattern recognition and response (“Look, a dog!”) are handled locally by the autonomous car. In our industry learned actions such as \"there is no one in the room,\" \"client arrived at 8:30 am yesterday,\" \\'\\'client has just returned from jog,\" and other learned actions would be turned into autonomous actions.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom this well read article last month, From the Clouds to the Fog, comes this obsrevation: “Back then, I advocated for enterprise energy monitoring and building control in the low-lying cumulus clouds. Today, I would look to managing energy and service delivery in local autonomous systems. These autonomous systems are the fog. Fog offers thinly disbursed nodes of intelligent actors.”\\n\\nFrom this article on evolving open source, The Edge of VOLTTRON’s Sword, comes this statement: “The software stack is available free on GitHub to put onto a small form factor computer and create your very own \\'edge device.\\' For the building and HVAC space, the platform speaks BACnet and MODBUS. Out of the box and on a mini pc it can be used as a data collection device.”\\n\\nArticle closes with: “True open source communities have been relatively rare in the building automation industry; Haystack and Sedona are the two others that immediately come to mind. It is our hope that VOLTTRON can become a robust and well supported platform with an active community of individuals and organizations dedicated to further development. Secure and open access to data is fundamental in realizing the future potential of the building automation industry.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently described changes during his keynote address at the company’s Build 2017 conference in Seattle. “We’re moving from what is today’s mobile-first, cloud-first world to a new world that is going to be made up of an intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWith IoT Edge, Microsoft now makes it easier for developers to move some of their computing needs to these devices. IoT Edge can run on Windows and Linux and on devices as small as a Raspberry Pi with only 128MB of memory. The Microsoft services that can run on these devices include Azure Machine Learning, Stream Analytics (which came to Edge devices earlier this year), Azure Functions, Microsoft’s AI services, and the Azure IoT Hub.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecently Intel launched deep learning on a USB stick. This ultra-low power VPU enables you to add visual intelligence and machine learning capabilities in battery-powered products such as autonomous drones, or intelligent security cameras — at the edge, without a connection to the network, or the need for a cloud backend for your machine-learning application.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis leap from cloud to tiny edge devices literally opens our world, but how to manage machine distributed collaboration?\\n\\nThis solution, described by Harbour Research, is waiting in the wings: Blockchain: Enabling Truly Distributed Collaboration. Blockchain has the potential to provide the foundation for a decentralized architecture that would allow permissioning of data to proper stakeholders in the ecosystem they are associated with, enabling devices to work together autonomously, without humans.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom Toby Considine\\'s August column, Cryptocurrency is more than just Blockchain and Bitcoin, comes these thoughts: \"I am watching closely a new CC project, IOTA, which is based on Tangle. Tangle uses directed asymmetric graphs instead of blockchain. Tangle supports forking a database, to rejoin later, which might be critical in IoT applications that may lose connections to the cloud. IOTA can operate without the cloud if an isolated market is desired. IOTA has been demonstrated running on devices as small as a Raspberry PI.\"\\n\\nIn case your mind (like mine) is now tangled this may help, from IOTA: http://iota.org.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this new autonomous machine economy, IOTA will be the backbone. The Tangle ledger is able to settle transactions with zero fees so devices can trade exact amounts of resources on-demand, as well as store data from sensors and dataloggers securely and verified on the ledger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe swarmed data collected and analyzed plus the learned actions are the feedstock for training machine-learning.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is a new world where powerful edge devices will learn what they need to know by simply being present and respond with learned actions while sharing their knowledge in a swarm like distributed collaboration. We will start with small victories but you will be amazed how fast this will happen, like horses to cars, but the change to autonomous things will occur even faster.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe autonomous things will provide seamless interaction learning our wishes. In the beginning we will express ourselves with data input, but quickly more autonomous devices pushed to the new ever-evolving edge will turn our feelings into data for machine distributed collaboration.\\n\\n\\n\\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are not common in today’s building automation systems. Some systems have features built into their software that represent the beginnings of this technology, but none have been able to capture the true benefits that autonomous actions on the edge will.\\n\\n\\n\\nNew-found visibility and context turns what was once darkness and noise into easily digestible and manageable chunks of actionable information, which now occurs autonomously on the edge.\\n\\nWe are presently working on cool thoughts for our education sessions for AHRExpo January 2018 Chicago: \"The Future of Building Automation: Growing Autonomous Buildings from the Intelligent Edge.\" Be sure to join us and share your thoughts with us on this exciting topic.\\n\\n\\n\\nKen Sinclair is the founder, owner, and publisher of an online resource called AutomatedBuildings.com.

       " \"Security PAGE\\n\\nPhysical Security Meets Technological Innovation\\n\\nFrom robots to drones, the gap between Hollywood and real-world security tech is closing rapidly. Here is the latest on what's new and cool in security technology. Gamma 2 Robotics From robots to drones, the gap between Hollywood and real-world security tech is closing rapidly. Here is the latest on what's new and cool in security technology.\\n\\nBy Naomi Millán, Senior Editor September 2017 - Security Article Use Policy\\n\\nTalk to physical security specialists and there’s one thing they want you to understand — that stuff you see on TV where they freeze a frame of surveillance video and zoom in down to the pores, that’s just not possible. Yet.\\n\\nThe gap between Hollywood and security technology in the real world is closing, though more slowly than some would like. In the realms of surveillance and video analytics, the security world is abuzz with advances in the capabilities of current technology. And the near future holds the promise of developments such as virtual command centers. Here is what facility managers can keep an eye on now as they consider tools to help augment their security team’s capabilities.\\n\\nRobots and drones\\n\\nWhen Mark Schreiber, president and principal consultant of Safeguards Consulting, talks about security robots, he prefers to use the term “unmanned ground vehicle” to more accurately reflect the capabilities of today’s technology. He currently sees a limited use case for security robots, which is tied to enhancing active surveillance efforts. Guard tours of a facility or campus can get to be monotonous work, where fatigue and boredom increase the chance for error. But a security robot could patrol the same space in a consistent manner, over and over.\\n\\nFacility managers should keep any visions of Robocop well in check, however. “It will take some time to really get out the different nuggets of value,” says Schreiber. “It’s only the advanced high-tech organizations that are really going to start running with the ball initially.”\\n\\nOne early adopter of security robots is Microsoft, where the robot program at the company’s Redmond, Wash., headquarters has been successful enough that the technology will be spread to other Microsoft campuses. “Think about it more as a mobile sensor platform,” says Mike Anderson, security program manager, Microsoft global security. “That’s all it really is.” Sensors mounted on the robot can be deployed to detect any number of factors, from unregistered vehicles in a parking lot to unusual heat patterns in a data center. At Microsoft, some robots were deployed with an emergency communication call button, so an individual needing immediate assistance in a parking lot could run up and open a communication line with security, for example.\\n\\n“The technology is still pretty young,” says Anderson. But he expects to see more robots patrolling places like malls or large corporate campuses in the next two to three years, “doing things that would enhance security operations, not replace them.”\\n\\nDrones, or unmanned aerial systems, have a very different impact. “They’re a totally different type of platform for the same type of security sensors and technologies that we use in a fixed platform in many different locations,” says Schreiber. A surveillance camera on a fixed pole has a distinct value, primarily gathering forensic data. But put the camera on a drone and you now have a very fast mobile platform for active surveillance and emergency response.\\n\\nOn a large campus, a drone can be on site within minutes where a first responder could take much longer. “With a drone platform, we can get there in a fraction of the time, immediately get video and other sensors on that incident, and quickly evaluate what response is needed,” says Schreiber. All that without having to endanger a human life, as would be the case to evaluate a dangerous situation, like an explosion.\\n\\nMore than deploying a drone security team, Anderson says most companies are focused on developing an anti-drone plan. How can facility managers detect a drone on their campus? How can they detect where the signal is coming from, take over the drone, and land it? Anderson says facility managers should start by establishing the drone policy for their campus, and then worry about anti-drone defenses. For example, at Microsoft, the company’s own researchers on drones and robotics have to get security’s permission first to operate on campus. “They just want to fly their drone wherever they want, and you can’t have that,” Anderson says. “We had to establish a pretty strict policy.”\\n\\nContinue Reading: Security Physical Security Meets Technological Innovation Security: Video Analytics and Machine Learning Gaining Momentum\\n\\nComments\",\n",
       " 'Emerging Technologies In FM And Real Estate\\n\\nBy Lisa Stanley\\n\\nFrom the October 2017 Issue\\n\\nThe impact that emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and others, will have on the real estate industry is just starting to be realized. Other industries, including financial services and insurance, are much further ahead than real estate and have made some significant advances in exploring how these technologies can be implemented in their businesses. Collaborative efforts have been formed that have already completed pilot projects. Major financial institutions have applied for patents to create applications and protect revenue streams. Platforms have been developed that are changing the way information is collected, shared, and stored—planting a firm footing in the ground for the future.\\n\\nJust how big an impact can emerging technologies have in how we conduct business? Gartner research firm is now tracking more than 2,000 technologies. Many companies are taking a “wait and see” approach, but is this approach managing risk—or risky business—for corporate real estate and facility management (FM)? While the sheer number of emerging technologies may appear daunting, there is an inherent danger in doing nothing.\\n\\nOpportunities for competitive advantage exist for organizations that can get a jump-start on determining how to harness the power of emerging technologies and which ones to pursue. Emerging technologies can turbocharge decision-making and connect information in ways that weren’t previously possible. For example, AI and machine learning hold promise for better decisions than the human brain has capacity for, with a learning curve that is far more sophisticated and faster than humans have demonstrated with much more experience. Healthcare is recognized as an industry leader for a variety of AI applications, including predicting recurrence of disease, cognitive robotics performing surgeries, and supply chain. Could acceptance of cognitive robotics applications for FM be far behind? AI applications for FM already include energy management, cleaning, waste removal, and catering, with strong potential for more applications to come.\\n\\nMeanwhile, blockchain is gaining attention, and implementations are advancing at an accelerated pace in some sectors. In a report published earlier this year by Deloitte’s Center for Financial Services, the value proposition of blockchain was explored for a variety of public utility services, including smart parking, energy billing, and core commercial real estate (CRE) operations. Blockchain technology isn’t coming, it’s here. Smart contracts, payments, maintenance schedules, and improvements can be built on a blockchain and shared with relevant parties on a secure platform.\\n\\nWhat is blockchain? Blockchain is a cloud-based, permanent, distributed digital ledger of activities between parties. Let’s break it down. Cloud-based means it doesn’t sit on your company’s private server, or any other company’s private server. The permanence of this ledger means it lives as a permanent record of activities between parties, such as recording property transfers, HVAC system activities, occupancy of cubicles, or security access. Over time, this historical perspective can enable you to improve your decision-making, make decisions faster, and can be shared with other emerging technologies, like AI. The distributed digital ledger means it’s distributed among a group of participants. This can be a large group, like a public blockchain accessible by anyone that holds records of real property transfers (think public records), or a private blockchain shared between a client and their service provider, software developer, a consultancy, or a benchmarking firm. Changes to the blockchain occur in plain view of all participants, improving transparency. Applications include cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) that can accomplish financial transactions in just seconds, smart contracts, and more.\\n\\nWhat steps must real estate and facility professionals take to prepare for these emerging technologies?\\n\\nStart with the data. We’re talking about (1) a strategy that starts with an unbiased assessment of the data that provides the information used to drive your business decisions at every level of the organization and (2) a mandate for a standardized approach to collecting, organizing, and analyzing data across business units, platforms, and companies to build an effective data governance program. This approach enables your organization to create the needed infrastructure to implement emerging technologies and a strong foundation for the future. No shortcuts are available at this stage of preparation, and the effort put forth now will help identify which emerging technologies hold the greatest opportunity for implementation.\\n\\nWhat we still see too often in FM are multiple platforms that don’t communicate with each other, creating disparate systems (and sometimes desperate measures) to extract information needed to move the organization forward. To implement emerging technologies effectively, team members need to develop the skills to make this transition to data governance, and build it into every aspect of the organization. Who is responsible for data governance? Every business unit in the organization should be, and the skillset to build and maintain a data governance program must be a top priority.\\n\\nLeveraging technology to improve business decisions has a foundation based at least in part on increasing the three Cs—collaboration, complexity, and connections between humans and machines. It’s a digital world, and there’s no turning back. A major challenge is to figure out how to allocate resources among these emerging technologies while managing risk. IT and business units must partner to determine priorities that will enable leaders to more carefully evaluate the myriad alternatives of emerging technologies available for investment and exploration.\\n\\nThere is no one emerging technology that provides an ideal solution to FM and CRE challenges. As with any investment in infrastructure, an evaluation of associated costs and benefits is required. Our industry requires collaborative and innovative leaders to step up and participate in pilot projects that explore applications of these technologies that will change the way we conduct every aspect of our business. Leaders who have the vision to commit to collaborative innovation will find extraordinary opportunities.\\n\\nAre you ready?\\n\\nStanley is CEO of OSCRE International, a member based organization focused on transforming the way digital information drives real estate businesses.

       " 'Future Visions: Will The Office Become Extinct By 2037?\\n\\nIn 20 years the world will undergo some dramatic changes, impacting the every aspect of our lives, from where we work to how we get our medical care. Some of the changes we might see in the future include pre-emptive crime prevention, offices becoming extinct, and as artificial intelligence rises, so will the need for more female attributes such as emotional intelligence. These are the findings of a new report by the Virgin Group — Future Visions — which explores what the world of business will look like in 20 years’ time.\\n\\nThrough Future Visions’ research, Sir Richard Branson, Founder of the Virgin Group, and his team brought together six of today’s greatest futurists, technologists, business pioneers, and strategists to create a vision of the future. Dr James Bellini, Araceli Camargo, Cindy Gallop, Ben Hammersley, Tracey Follows, and Peter Smith all shared their predictions on what the entrepreneurs of tomorrow need to be considering today.\\n\\nWhat The Future Holds\\n\\nThe future is often viewed with the doom and gloom of mass-unemployment, marginalization, and poor health, which many attribute to rapid technological developments. However, Future Visions’ work lays out a new vision of a more inclusive, intellectual, and well-rounded society.\\n\\nVirgin’s Future Vision report findings include:\\n\\nThe office will be no more, and communities will value interaction more than ever.
